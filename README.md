Code for my Master's Thesis analyzing fMRI data. Comparing psilocybin and escitalopram for depression treatment. Looking at the mechanistic changes to emotions when listening to music. 

Everything is codede in a a Jupyter Kernel with **Python 3.7.16**. Older version of Python is used because of capabilities of older NITools functions. General notes for the file are at the top of the Jupyter Notebook file. 

Note/Highlights

- Created loops for thresholding large amounts of fMRI data.
- Identifying information is removed
- Pickling data in succint format
